ed is an 8-bit-clean, POSIX-compliant line editor.  It should work with
any regular expression package that conforms to the POSIX interface
standard, such as GNU regex(3).

If reliable signals are supported (e.g., POSIX sigaction(2)), it should
compile with little trouble.  Otherwise, the macros SPL1() and SPL0()
should be redefined to disable interrupts.

The file `POSIX' describes extensions to and deviations from the POSIX
standard.

The ./test directory contains regression tests for ed. The README
file in that directory explains how to run these.

For a description of the ed algorithm, see Kernighan and Plauger's book
"Software Tools in Pascal," Addison-Wesley, 1981.

This version was forked from commit 14a6528f603d0f6b3ec1246547f79ecd72819c70
at 2019-12-13T04:28Z by finnoleary@inventati.org and edited to compile on and
work with GNU Libc systems. This was a hasty snarf 'n edit, but feel free to
mail me with any problems you encounter. The changes made were:

- Added bsdcompat{.c,.h} with the BSD functions required
- Added #include "bsdcompat.h" to ed.h
- Altered Makefile to compile the program without needing includes from the
  OpenBSD build system

Please note that test/ and USD.doc/ have not been tested, although they
shouldn't be too difficult to get running. Also compiling with -Wall -Werror is
a bad idea, it would require adding more BSD functions, this is minimal
effort :)
